# Win32-OpenGL-Test
A test/example of a Win32 self-drawing program, using the resources of Microsoft Windows MinGW64 and OpenGL.

I tested this code on Windows 10 x64, Windows 7 x64, Windows XP x64, Windows XP x86. I don't know if it will run on Windows 11.

I made this code just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from it.
